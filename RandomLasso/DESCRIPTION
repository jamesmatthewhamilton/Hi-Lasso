Description: Library provides an array of functions for Randomized Regression
    Analysis (RRA), which are potent tools for linear model feature selection.
    This concept was first introduced by Sijian Wang et.al. Random Lasso (2011).
    This package provides tools for Random Lasso, as well latter and
    state-of-the-art adaptations such as Hi-Lasso (2019).
